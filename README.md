## Hi 👋

I am Shenggui Li (Frank), a 📚 PhD student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am currently working on 📑 research on efficient training and serving, particularly LLMs, diffusion, and RLHF. In my spare time, I contribute to open-source projects such as ⚡️ [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).

I spent wonderful time during undergraduate studies and start-up period. You can know more about me by visiting my 💻 [personal website](https://franklee.xyz/).
